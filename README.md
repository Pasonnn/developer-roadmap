# Developer Roadmap

A comprehensive learning repository for fullstack development knowledge and theory, based on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh).

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository serves as a structured learning path for fullstack development, focusing on **theoretical knowledge and understanding** of technologies, concepts, and best practices. The emphasis is on building a solid foundation of knowledge rather than hands-on project implementation.

### Learning Philosophy

- **Theory-First Approach**: Deep understanding of concepts, principles, and best practices
- **Knowledge Building**: Comprehensive coverage of technologies and their use cases
- **Structured Learning**: Organized by domain (Frontend, Backend) for systematic progression
- **Reference Material**: Acts as a knowledge base for fullstack development topics
